# Mobile-Shopping-store
This project is a mobile shopping store created with HTML for structure, JavaScript for interactive elements on the user interface, and PHP to connect to a server-side database. The database likely stores product information, user data (if user accounts are implemented), and order details (if the store allows purchasing).
